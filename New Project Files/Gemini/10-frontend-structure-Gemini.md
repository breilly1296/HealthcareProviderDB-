# Prompt Analysis: 10-frontend-structure.md

**Type:** Architecture Review
**Quality Rating:** 3/5

## Intent/Goal
To analyze the Next.js frontend structure.

## Components
- **File Inventory:** Lists standard Next.js folders (`app/`, `components/`).
- **Questions:** Generic questions about state management and responsiveness.

## Gaps/Improvements
- **Generic:** This prompt could apply to *any* Next.js project. It lacks VerifyMyProvider context.
- **Specifics Needed:** Should ask about:
  - "Search Interface components"
  - "Verification Modal flow"
  - "Confidence Score display component"
  - "Tailwind config specific to the brand"

## Analysis
Too generic. Needs to be tailored to the specific UI requirements of the project (Provider Cards, Verification flows).
