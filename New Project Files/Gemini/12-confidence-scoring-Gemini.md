# Prompt Analysis: 12-confidence-scoring.md

**Type:** Algorithm Documentation/Review
**Quality Rating:** 5/5

## Intent/Goal
To document and review the core competitive differentiator: the Confidence Scoring Algorithm.

## Components
- **Algorithm Definition:** Detailed breakdown of the 0-100 point system (Source, Recency, Verification, Agreement).
- **Test References:** Points to `confidenceService.test.ts` and mentions "82 passing tests".
- **Bug History:** Notes a specific bug fix ("Score now increases correctly...").
- **Visuals:** Defines the Color Coding (Green/Yellow/Red) and Messaging for the UI.
- **Scenarios:** Provides concrete examples of score calculations.

## Gaps/Improvements
- **None.** This is an excellent deep-dive into business logic.

## Analysis
Extremely high value. It captures the "secret sauce" of the application in a way that allows an agent to debug logic errors or implement frontend displays accurately.
