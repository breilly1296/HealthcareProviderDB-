# Prompt Analysis: 24-development-workflow.md

**Type:** Developer Guide
**Quality Rating:** 5/5

## Intent/Goal
To enforce the "Golden Rule" of development and document tool usage.

## Components
- **The Golden Rule:** "ALL code changes happen in Claude Code... NEVER edit in Cloud Shell."
- **Tool Matrix:** What to use Claude Code for vs gcloud CLI.
- **Workflow Diagrams:** Visualizing the flow.
- **Emergency Procedures:** What to do when production breaks.
- **Credential Locations:** References where to find passwords (Proton Pass).

## Gaps/Improvements
- **None.** This is a critical behavioral guide for the developer/agent.

## Analysis
Essential for maintaining sanity in a cloud development environment. The "Golden Rule" likely comes from painful experience with non-persistent Cloud Shell edits.
