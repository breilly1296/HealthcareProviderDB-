# Prompt Analysis: 26-full-security-audit.md

**Type:** Meta-Sequencer
**Quality Rating:** 1/5

## Intent/Goal
To trigger a full security audit by chaining other prompts.

## Components
- **Placeholder:** Generic template.

## Gaps/Improvements
- **Empty:** This should ideally be a script that says:
  1. Run `01-database-schema`
  2. Run `06-api-routes`
  3. Run `08-rate-limiting`
  4. Compile results into `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Analysis
Currently non-functional. Needs to be defined as a sequencer.
