**Type:** Strategy/Architecture
**Quality Rating:** 5/5

## Intent/Goal
To define the relationship between VerifyMyProvider and its parent/sister product, "OwnMyHealth".

## Components
- **Architecture Diagram (ASCII):** Visualizing the "Portfolio Model".
- **User Journeys:** Mapping how users flow between the two products (Casual vs Power User).
- **Compliance Boundary:** Explaining *why* they are separate (HIPAA vs Non-HIPAA).
- **Data Synergy:** What data flows where.
- **Exit Strategy:** How separating the products creates "Optionality" for selling them.

## Gaps/Improvements
- **None.** This is high-level strategic thinking encoded into a prompt.

Very sophisticated prompt. It handles the complex business logic of running two related but legally distinct products.
