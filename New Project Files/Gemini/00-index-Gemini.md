# Prompt Analysis: 00-index.md

**Type:** Index/Meta
**Quality Rating:** 5/5

## Intent/Goal
To serve as the central navigation hub for all other prompts, categorized by function (Security, Documentation, Meta). It provides a "Quick Start" guide for different user personas (New Developer, Security Auditor, Troubleshooter).

## Components
- **Categorized Tables:** Groups prompts by Security, Documentation, and Meta.
- **Priority Indicators:** Columns for "Critical", "High", "Medium".
- **Quick Start Guide:** Actionable workflows (e.g., "Running a Security Audit? Start here").
- **Usage Tips:** Advice on which AI tool (Claude Code vs Claude.ai) suits which prompt.
- **Context:** Comparison table ("VerifyMyProvider vs OwnMyHealth") to set high-level constraints.

## Gaps/Improvements
- **Missing File:** References `27-full-doc-refresh` which appears to be missing from the file system.
- **Maintenance:** Needs to be manually updated if new prompts are added.

## Analysis
This is an excellent index file. It doesn't just list files; it provides *operational context*. The "Usage Tips" section is particularly valuable for an AI agent or developer to know *how* to execute the prompts.
